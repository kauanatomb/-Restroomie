<h1 align="center">Restroomie</h1>
<p align="center">Restroomie is a mobile project developed as part of my web development bootcamp at Le Wagon, showcasing my acquired skills and knowledge. The goal of Restroomie is to help people find public restrooms in Berlin that are accessible and baby-friendly.

With Restroomie, you can view your current location on a map, discover nearby restrooms, and get directions to them. You have the ability to bookmark your favorite restrooms, provide ratings and reviews, as well as add new restrooms to the map if they're not already listed.</p>
